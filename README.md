# CodeClause_BrainTumorDetection

This repository contains code for a brain tumor classification project. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify brain tumor images into different categories.

The dataset used for this project consists of brain tumor images, which are divided into two classes: "no_tumor" and "glioma_tumor" You can also incllue the remaining two classes. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection)

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3 and the following dependencies installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and OpenCV. You can install these dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

To use the code, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the main script to train the classifier on the dataset and evaluate its performance. The results will be displayed in the console.

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
